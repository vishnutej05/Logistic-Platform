# Logistics Platform

## Overview

Efficient and reliable transportation of goods is essential in today's fast-paced world. However, traditional logistics solutions often lack transparency, real-time tracking, and user flexibility. The Logistics Platform addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, user-centric solution for on-demand transportation. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it empowers users to:

## Features

- **User-Centric Booking**: Users can directly choose their preferred driver, providing more control over their transportation experience.
- **Real-Time Location Sharing (Google Maps API)**: Track the assigned driverâ€™s location in real-time as they move, ensuring transparency and improving user satisfaction.
- **Driver and Fleet Management**: Admins can easily manage the fleet of drivers and vehicles, update statuses, and monitor availability.
- **Booking Workflow**: From booking creation to job completion, the system ensures efficient tracking of job statuses and driver updates.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different roles (admin, driver, user) ensure secure access and permission management for data and features.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication for all users via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is fully responsive, ensuring seamless access on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
